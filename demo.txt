What is your favorite movie?

	My favorite movie is "Good Will Hunting".

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

	I would love to travel to Japan, I would be interested to see how
	different the culture is there.  Most of the places I have currently
	been to are culturally similar to the US.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

	I would go with telekinesis.  I think the ability to move things using just 
	your mind opens up a larger set of powers than just moving object.  For example,
	If you wanted to fly, just use the ability on yourself.
